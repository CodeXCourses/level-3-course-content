# Assignment: Daily Project Log - Capstone Week

## Objective

To document and reflect on your daily progress during the Capstone Project week. This ongoing assignment requires you to update the README.md of your project repository daily, providing insights into the work completed, challenges encountered, and knowledge gained.

## Instructions

### Daily Log Update

For each day of the project week, add a new section in your project's README.md titled **Day [Number] Log**. Each day's log should include the following:

1. **Tasks Completed**: Briefly list the specific tasks or features you worked on for the day. Examples might include "Initialized Next.js project and Firebase integration" or "Created Header and Main Content Area components".

2. **Challenges and Solutions**: Describe any challenges you faced during the day's work and how you addressed them. If relevant, include links to resources or documentation that helped you overcome these challenges.

3. **Learnings and Insights**: Share any new concepts, tools, or techniques you learned while working on the day's tasks. Reflect on how these learnings might impact your future development work.

4. **Next Steps**: Outline what you plan to work on in the next session, based on the current progress and any pending tasks.

### Format Example

Here's an example of how to format your daily log in the README.md:

```markdown
## Day 1 Log

```

### Submission Guidelines

- **Daily Update**: Ensure your README.md is updated daily with the new log section.
- **Final Submission**: At the end of the week, submit the URL of your GitHub repository as your assignment submission. Your repository should contain the complete code for your project and a README.md with detailed logs for each day.

## Evaluation Rubric

Your daily logs will be assessed based on the clarity of documentation, the progress demonstrated, and the reflective insights provided. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive review of your project development process and encourages continuous learning and improvement.
