# Assignment: Next.js Practice

## Objective

This optional assignment is designed as extra practice to help you consolidate your understanding of key Next.js and React concepts. By building a simple web application layout, you will apply foundational principles such as component-based design, state and props management, dynamic UI updates, and modular code architecture. This exercise provides an opportunity to reinforce your learning and prepare for more advanced topics.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Component Creation

1. **Create Basic Components**:
   - Develop four basic components representing different parts of a web application: `Header`, `MainContent`, `Sidebar`, and `Footer`. Each component should return a simple JSX element indicating its content area.

### Part 2: Layout Assembly with CSS Grid

1. **Construct the Layout Component**:
   - Create a `Layout` component that incorporates the `Header`, `MainContent`, `Sidebar`, and `Footer` components.
   - Use CSS Grid in an external stylesheet to arrange these components into a coherent layout. Your layout should include a header at the top, a sidebar and main content in the middle, and a footer at the bottom.

### Part 3: Styling

1. **Apply Basic Styles**:
   - Style each component with basic CSS to visually distinguish between them. Consider background colors, padding, or borders.

### Part 4: Dynamic Interaction (Optional)

1. **Toggle Sidebar**:
   - Implement a button in the `Header` component that toggles the visibility of the `Sidebar`. Use the `useState` hook to manage the sidebar's visibility state.

### Part 5: GitHub Repository Update

- **Commit Your Changes**:
  - Commit all changes to your project with descriptive commit messages. This includes new components, layout modifications, and any additional features you implemented.
- **Push to GitHub**:
  - Ensure your GitHub repository is up to date by pushing the latest changes.

### Part 6: Reflection (Optional)

- **Document Your Learning**:
  - In the README.md file or a separate document, reflect on the learning process for this assignment. Discuss any challenges you faced, how you overcame them, and any new insights gained from applying these foundational concepts.

## Note

As this assignment is for extra practice and self-assessment, submission is optional and a formal rubric will not apply. It's an opportunity for you to explore and apply the concepts covered in this course freely. Feel encouraged to push your repository to GitHub to track your progress and for future reference.
