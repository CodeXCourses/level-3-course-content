# Week 2: Introduction to Next.js and React Fundamentals

## Day 1: Introduction to Next.js and React Basics

### Hour 1: Understanding Next.js and React

- What is Next.js and its advantages for web development.
- Introduction to React and its core concepts.
- Discussion on JSX, its syntax, and how it enables dynamic UI construction.

### Hour 2: Exploring the File Structure

- Navigating the default file structure of a Next.js project.
- Importance of the `public` directory for static assets, including placing `favicon.ico` for automatic recognition.
- Deleting unnecessary files and directories to clean up the project structure.

### Hour 3: Version Control with Git

- Initializing a Git repository within a Next.js project.
- Best practices for using `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules` and other non-essential files.
- Basic Git commands for committing changes and pushing a project to GitHub.

## Day 2: Introduction to React State with `useState`

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Introduction to state management in React with the `useState` hook.
- Best practices for updating state to avoid direct mutations.
- **Code Example**: Implement a counter component with increment, decrement, and reset functionalities.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Managing form input state with `useState` and handling form submissions.
- Discussion on controlled versus uncontrolled components.
- **Code Example**: Create a form that captures user input and displays the input on submission.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Implement state management in a Next.js application using `useState`.
- **Assignment**: Build a form with validation that displays submitted data.

## Day 3: Fetching Data with `useEffect`

### Hour 1: Introduction to `useEffect` and API Calls

- Explaining the `useEffect` hook and its use for side effects in React components.
- Making a simple API call to fetch a single item's data using `fetch` within `useEffect`.

### Hour 2: Handling API Responses

- Managing loading states and displaying fetched data.
- Introduction to error handling in API calls and displaying error messages.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Implement a component that makes an API call to fetch and display a single item.
- **Assignment**: Create a component that fetches and displays data, incorporating error handling and loading states.

## Day 4: Client-Side Navigation and Data Mapping

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Introduction to client-side navigation in Next.js with the `Link` component.
- Rendering lists with `map` and the importance of the `key` prop.
- **Code Example**: Implement a navigation menu with `Link` and display a list of fetched items.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Conditional rendering techniques for displaying different UI components.
- Passing data to components using props.
- **Code Example**: Create a component that changes its layout (e.g., list or grid view) based on user interaction.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Implement client-side navigation and render dynamic lists of data.
- **Assignment**: Build a feature allowing users to toggle between different views of data.

# Week 2: Introduction to Next.js and React Fundamentals

## Day 5: Comprehensive Review and Optional Expansion Assignment

### Hour 1: Consolidated Review of Next.js and React Concepts

- Summarize the key learnings of the week, emphasizing Next.js benefits, React's core concepts, JSX syntax, and dynamic UI construction techniques.
- Interactive review session on state management with `useState`, effects with `useEffect`, and the importance of modular code architecture in React applications.
- Address student questions and clarify any complex topics discussed during the week.

### Hour 2: Practical Examples and Common Pitfalls

- Walk through practical examples that combine the week's topics, showcasing typical use cases in web development with Next.js and React.
- Discuss common pitfalls in React development, such as improper state management, and how to avoid them.
- **Code Example**: A mini-project that integrates `useState` and `useEffect` for a dynamic user interface, such as a live search feature or a simple blog post fetcher.

### Hour 3: Optional Assignment - Expanding Knowledge

- **Optional Assignment**: Encourage students to create a small Next.js project that incorporates learned concepts and explores additional functionalities. Possible project ideas include:
  - A ToDo List application with basic CRUD operations, leveraging `useState` for state management.
  - A simple blog using Next.js where posts are fetched from a public API and displayed using `useEffect`.
  - Implementing a feature that requires students to research and integrate a new npm package that wasn't covered in the lessons, fostering self-directed learning and exploration.

**Assignment Objectives**:

- Apply and reinforce the concepts learned during the week.
- Encourage exploration of Next.js documentation and React ecosystem to solve real-world problems.
- Practice building a small, complete project from scratch, reinforcing the project setup process and modular development approach.
