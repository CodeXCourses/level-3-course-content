- **Assignment**: Build a form with validation that displays submitted data.

## Day 3: Fetching Data with `useEffect`

### Hour 1: Introduction to `useEffect` and API Calls
- Explaining the `useEffect` hook and its use for side effects in React components.
- Making a simple API call to fetch a single item's data using `fetch` within `useEffect`.

### Hour 2: Handling API Responses
- Managing loading states and displaying fetched data.
- Introduction to error handling in API calls and displaying error messages.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice
- Implement a component that makes an API call to fetch and display a single item.
- **Assignment**: Create a component that fetches and displays data, incorporating error handling and loading states.

## Day 4: Client-Side Navigation and Data Mapping

### Hour 1: Demo Code
- Introduction to client-side navigation in Next.js with the `Link` component.
