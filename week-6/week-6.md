# Week 6: Firebase Integration in Next.js Applications

## Day 1: Introduction to Firebase and Its Services

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Overview of Firebase: Understanding its capabilities and how it can be integrated into Next.js projects.
- Setting up Firebase in a Next.js project: Creating a Firebase project, installing Firebase SDK, and initializing Firebase.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Introduction to Firebase Authentication: Setting up authentication methods (e.g., Google Sign-In).
- Implementing a basic authentication flow in Next.js: Login, logout, and handling user sessions.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Integrating Firebase Authentication into the Todo application.
- **Assignment**: Add Google Sign-In to the Todo application and handle user authentication states.

## Day 2: Integrating Firebase Auth for User Authentication in Next.js

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Deep dive into Firebase Auth: Exploring other authentication methods (e.g., Email/Password, Facebook Login).
- Enhancing authentication flows with email verification and password reset functionalities.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Implementing private and protected routes in Next.js based on authentication status.
- Using Firebase Auth hooks (e.g., `useAuthState`) to manage user sessions across the application.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Students implement additional authentication methods and secure routes in their Next.js applications.
- **Assignment**: Create a user profile page that displays information only after authentication.

## Day 3: Building Firestore Database Structure for the Todo Application

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Introduction to Firestore: Understanding its NoSQL structure and how to design a database schema.
- Setting up Firestore in the Firebase project and integrating it with the Next.js application.

### Hour 2 - 3: Demo Code

- CRUD operations in Firestore: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents.
- No assignment

## Day 4: Review of day 3, more practice, Q&A

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Setting up Firestore in the Firebase project and integrating it with the Next.js application.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- CRUD operations in Firestore: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents.
- Implementing real-time data fetching in Next.js using Firestore.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Implementing advanced Firestore features in the Todo application.
- **Assignment**: Add functionality to filter todos by status (e.g., completed, pending) using Firestore queries.

## Day 5: Best Practices for Firebase Security and Rules

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Overview of Firebase security rules: Structuring rules for authentication, validation, and data access control.
- Writing and testing Firestore security rules to protect data integrity and privacy.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Best practices for using Firebase in production: Monitoring, error handling, and optimizing Firebase usage to reduce costs.
- Introduction to Firebase Extensions for extending Firebase capabilities with pre-packaged solutions.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Applying security rules to the Firestore database used in the Todo application.
- **Assignment**: Review and refactor Firebase integration in the Todo application for optimization and security.

This week aims to equip students with the skills needed to integrate Firebase services into their Next.js applications, focusing on authentication, Firestore database management, and securing applications with Firebase rules. The practical assignments encourage students to apply these concepts in a real-world project, enhancing their understanding and proficiency with Firebase.
