# Week 7: Capstone Project Development - Community Market App

## Overview

This week, students will develop a Community Market Application using Next.js and Firebase, integrating all the concepts learned in the previous weeks. The project will reinforce front-end development skills, Firebase integration, styling with Sass and Tailwind CSS, and basic testing with Jest. By the end of the week, students will have a fully functional application that can be included in their portfolio.

## Day 1: Project Planning and Initial Setup

- Introduction to the capstone project, defining objectives, core features, and user stories.
- Setting up the project in Next.js, integrating Firebase for backend services.
- Establishing project structure, coding standards, and initial Git repository setup.

## Day 2: Firebase Integration and Core Features Development

- Implementing Firebase Authentication for user sign-up and login functionalities.
- Setting up Firestore database, defining data models for products, and implementing CRUD operations for product listings.

## Day 3: Styling and User Interface Enhancement

- Introducing CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS for styling, focusing on responsive design and UI components.
- Applying styling to the application's layout, navigation, forms, and listing components.

## Day 4: Adding Advanced Features and Testing

- Incorporating advanced Firebase features, such as storage for images and real-time updates with Firestore.
- Introduction to Jest for writing basic unit tests for React components and Firebase service functions.

## Day 5: Finalizing the Project and Preparing for Presentation

- Reviewing project progress, prioritizing remaining features, and implementing final touches.
- Conducting peer reviews, debugging, and refining the application.
- Preparing a brief presentation or demo of the project for potential inclusion in individual portfolios.

## Final Showcase (Next Week)

- Students will have the opportunity to present their Community Market Application during the final showcase.
