# Week 4: Unit Testing with Jest in Node.js

## Day 1: Introduction to Jest and Setting Up in a Node.js Environment

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Introduction to Jest and the significance of unit testing in software development.
- Installing Jest and configuring a Node.js project for testing.
- Basic structure of a Jest test (`describe`, `it`, `expect`).

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Writing your first tests: Testing simple JavaScript functions.
- Understanding assertions and matching with Jest.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Setting up Jest in personal projects.
- Writing tests for basic JavaScript functions (e.g., string manipulation, arithmetic operations).
- **Assignment**: Create a utility function that performs an array operation (e.g., filtering, mapping) and write tests for it.

## Day 2: Writing Unit Tests for Basic Node.js Functions

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Deepening understanding of Jest with more complex tests.
- Testing asynchronous code: Callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Introduction to mocking: Simplifying tests by mocking external dependencies.
- Best practices for organizing tests in a project.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Writing tests for functions that manipulate Arrays using different JavaScript methods.
- Instructor provides support on testing asynchronous code and implementing mocks.
- **Assignment**: Develop and test a function that combines multiple array manipulations (e.g., filter, then map, then reduce).

## Day 3: Testing Classes and Integration Testing in Node.js

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Introduction to testing classes in JavaScript with Jest.
- Writing unit tests for class methods.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Building a complex class that represents a real-world object (e.g., a shopping cart) with multiple methods.
- Demonstrating how to write tests for each method and the class as a whole.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Students create their own class (e.g., a ToDo list manager) and write unit tests for its methods.
- Instructor assists with class design and testing strategies.
- **Assignment**: Integrate the tested class into a small application or script to demonstrate its functionality in a real-world scenario.

## Day 4: Introduction to Using Jest with Next.js

### Hour 1: Demo Code

- Brief overview of Next.js and its testing challenges.
- Setting up Jest in a Next.js project.

### Hour 2: Demo Code

- Writing simple tests for Next.js components (e.g., testing a component renders correctly).
- Introduction to testing hooks and events in React components.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Students apply Jest to test a simple component in their Next.js application.
- Instructor available for guidance on Next.js specific testing challenges.
- **Assignment**: Test a new or existing Next.js component, focusing on user interaction and state changes.

## Day 5: Review and Consolidation

### Hour 1: Review

- Recap of the week’s topics with a Q&A session to clarify any doubts.
- Highlighting best practices in testing with Jest.

### Hour 2: Advanced Testing Concepts (Overview)

- Brief discussion on integration tests and test coverage without deep diving into implementation.

### Hour 3: Hands-On Practice

- Completing pending assignments and improving tests based on feedback.
- Peer review session for sharing testing strategies and learning from each other’s approaches.

This week's content is designed to build confidence in writing tests with Jest, covering from basic unit tests to more complex class testing, and introducing testing in a Next.js environment, suitable for beginners.
